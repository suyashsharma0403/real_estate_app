# Real Estate App

A simple real estate app that shows users a list of available houses for sale in a ListView. The user can filter through the list using a search bar(filtering by city and zip code). Once a user clicks a house on the list, they are taken to another page showing a detailed view of the selected house along with the location of the house on a map widget. The app also contains an info page about the developer.
